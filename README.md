# AI PDF Chatbot & Agent Powered by LangChain and LangGraph

This monorepo is a customizable template example of an AI chatbot agent that "ingests" PDF documents, stores embeddings in a vector database (Supabase), and then answers user queries using OpenAI (or another LLM provider) utilising LangChain and LangGraph as orchestration frameworks.

This template is also an accompanying example to the book [Learning LangChain (O'Reilly)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-langchain/9781098167271): Building AI and LLM applications with LangChain and LangGraph.
